## Usage

* Add the dependency:
```clojure

* `datomic-api` for test purposes uses [Datomic Free](https://github.com/alexanderkiel/datomic-free) (:warning: outdated)
* Feel free to integrate with your Datomic cloud or dev-local from updated datomic:
    * `connect` is received as `conn` argument by the all the functions, just pass your desired datomic version as client to your local `connect` function
    * Be aware that currently, the lib is tested just over datomic-free api
